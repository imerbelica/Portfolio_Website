                                        and my understanding of the web development stack with this website. I began experimenting
                                        with building websites using HTML and CSS in my freshman year in college in the last 4 years
                                        I’ve been able to refine and fine tune my skills with these languages as well as introduce
                                        different languages such as javascript and PHP to my programming toolkit to allow for more
                                        complex and capable websites. While tinkering with website building I’ve tried to improve
                                        my knowledge of the various APIs available to me as a programmer, and I’ve implemented a
                                        number of these in experimental websites, I’ve used everything from weather, to mapping API
                                        while growing my knowledge in web development. I began building this website during my last
                                        semester at the University of Hartford in the Fall of 2021 and have slowly been contributing
                                        to it since then and plan to continue that for the foreseeable future.

                                    <p>During the Spring semester of my senior year in college I thought it might be fun
                                        and interesting to take on a side project and begin to learn about game development.
                                        I’ve always enjoyed playing video games and have appreciated the design aspect of
                                        the games I’ve played and thought about what went into developing one. Upon doing
                                        some research I decided to make a simple game that resembled something like the popular
                                        subway surfer using unity, naturally while developing with unity I gained some important
                                        knowledge of C# scripting. The game was simple, but it helped me gain perspective on how
                                        development took place and made me aware of the various tools I had at my disposal using
                                        unity. I completed the game a few months after starting, and I can say that I’m pretty
                                        comfortable with unity and C# as a result.

                                        the task and would need to present our finding upon the completion of the task.
                                        This project expanded my knowledge of how the data mining and analysis workflow
                                        takes place and created more familiarity with the language we chose to accomplish
                                        the tasks outlined, this being Python. As a topic we selected space, and we were
                                        able to find a dataset on Kaggle describing every global space mission that’s
                                        taken place since 1959. We performed a cost analysis on these missions comparing
                                        the cost efficiency of private and public space missions and came to the conclusion
                                        that generally private space missions tend to be more cost-efficient, upon doing
                                        some research we concluded that this was likely due to lightened regulations for
                                        the private sector. My comfortability with python grew substantially throughout
                                        the project particularly with specific popular libraries offered by the language
                                        such as pandas, sklearn, and scipy. The project as a whole really helped me grow
                                        as a developer and data scientist.

                                    <p>The hospital management application that my group and I created, in my software
                                        development course in spring 2021 was one of my most complete projects implementing
                                        a full stack of programming languages. The course was entirely based around a
                                        single project, and we had the entirety of the semester to complete it, communicating
                                        with team members and the client (professor) alike in order to simulate a real world
                                        development experience. Our group elected to work with Java as a backend language,
                                        MySQL for our database needs, MySQL server for hosting the database, and Swing for
                                        the front end of the application. I gained a lot of experience with all of these
                                        technologies and was able to devote a lot of time to developing a complete full
                                        stack application. The communicative dynamic was a unique experience, and I feel
                                        like it improved my ability to express my thoughts, ideas, and questions more
                                        effectively with my team members as well as the client for whom we were developing
                                        the project. Additionally, one of the unique requirements for this project was
                                        documentation with a degree of detail that I didn’t have any prior experience with.
                                        We were tasked with creating an SRS document, class and object diagrams, UI prototypes,
                                        and test case scenarios using JUnit.  The object gave me great exposure to how the
                                        entire development process takes place and gave me more experience using MySQL,
                                        MySQL Server, and Java.

                                    <p>In June 2021, I took part in one of the most rewarding learning experiences of my
                                        college career, the NASA Rock On Workshop. This was a two-week-long workshop in
                                        which groups from twenty-five universities from around the country worked together
                                        to build space instruments capable of collecting environmental readings 73 miles
                                        above the earths surface. The payloads built during the workshop would be sent to
                                        space on NASA’s two-stage Terrier-Orion rocket and upon its landing in the Atlantic
                                        Ocean the payloads would be retrieved such that the data can be viewed and analyzed.
                                        The Experience as a whole was amazing and I was able to develop a number of skills
                                        throughout, students were responsible for assembling the payload by soldering the
                                        sensors and instruments to the PCBs provided in the kit, programming the Arduino
                                        boards using c++, and testing each of the components before flight. I have a real
                                        passion for space, because of this I found this entire experience to be really
                                        rewarding and enjoyable.

                                    <p>During the Fall 2021 semester I took on a course that gave me much more insight
                                        into the mechanical engineering discipline, this course was Mechatronics and System
                                        Design. This was a project based course that taught the fundamentals of mechatronics,
                                        a combination of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science.
                                        I gained a number of skills throughout the semester like the ability to take a problem
                                        statement and derive a free body diagram, block diagram, equation of motion, and
                                        eventually Lab View simulation from that problem statement. I utilized these skills
                                        during the final project we were tasked with at the end of the semester which was
                                        to simulate a real world problem that could be remedied using Mechatronics practices.
                                        I chose to model and simulate an active suspension system using a PID controller on
                                        Lab View and was able to demonstrate the ability of such a system to maximize both
                                        the comfort and handling of the vehicle in question. Additionally, I simulated a
                                        passive suspension system in order to contrast the two options and demonstrate the
                                        superiority of the active system. The project gave me experience and exposure to
                                        the Lab View simulation software, mechanical systems, and the planning and modeling
                                        system that takes place when developing engineering solutions.

                                    <p>Upon Graduation in December 2021, I grew more interested in development on apple
                                        platforms, as a result I thought it would be fitting to take on a swift project,
                                        more specifically a swift project that could have a practical application in the
                                        workplace. Having made some simple applications prior using swift I felt ready
                                        to take the steps necessary to make something fully featured and really polished,
                                        I found exactly what I was looking for when I stumbled on Apples first party
                                        intermediate course on the swift programming language. This course helped me better
                                        understand the language and the features it offered to developers, the course also
                                        outlined how to take an application to the App Store from scratch, that application
                                        was Scrum Dinger. The concept of the application is simple and incredibly functional,
                                        moreover it contains a number of the programming characteristics that most useful
                                        applications would require. Scrum Dinger was a tool that could help development
                                        teams manage their scrum sessions, by allowing users to customize parameters such
                                        as team members, scrum durations, and projects titles and later conduct their scrum
                                        meetings according to these parameters. The app would run timers showing each member
                                        they’re remaining time and notifying them when that time would be up. While the app
                                        is conceptually simple, it is fully featured, which is why it was such a great
                                        learning experience, it allowed me to learn things like adding reminders from
                                        within an application and adding accessibility functionality to an application to
                                        cater to all users.
