                                    <p>I made my best efforts to display some of my knowledge and experience in Web Development
                                        and my understanding of the web development stack with this website. I began experimenting
                                        with building websites using HTML and CSS in my freshman year in college in the last 4 years
                                        I’ve been able to refine and fine tune my skills with these languages as well as introduce
                                        different languages such as javascript and PHP to my programming toolkit to allow for more
                                        complex and capable websites. While tinkering with website building I’ve tried to improve
                                        my knowledge of the various APIs available to me as a programmer, and I’ve implemented a
                                        number of these in experimental websites, I’ve used everything from weather, to mapping API
                                        while growing my knowledge in web development. I began building this website during my last
                                        semester at the University of Hartford in the Fall of 2021 and have slowly been contributing
                                        to it since then and plan to continue that for the foreseeable future.

                                    <p>During the Spring semester of my senior year in college I thought it might be fun
                                        and interesting to take on a side project and begin to learn about game development.
                                        I’ve always enjoyed playing video games and have appreciated the design aspect of
                                        the games I’ve played and thought about what went into developing one. Upon doing
                                        some research I decided to make a simple game that resembled something like the popular
                                        subway surfer using unity, naturally while developing with unity I gained some important
                                        knowledge of C# scripting. The game was simple, but it helped me gain perspective on how
                                        development took place and made me aware of the various tools I had at my disposal using
                                        unity. I completed the game a few months after starting, and I can say that I’m pretty
                                        comfortable with unity and C# as a result.</p>

                                    <p>During the Fall 2020 semester at the University of Hartford I was tasked with
                                        a partner project in my Data Mining course. The concept of the project was
                                        simple, find a topic of interest find a large dataset related to that topic
                                        and draw some conclusions on the topic at hand based upon the data presented.
                                        We were free to use our choice of technologies, and data sources to accomplish
                                        the task and would need to present our finding upon the completion of the task.
                                        This project expanded my knowledge of how the data mining and analysis workflow
                                        takes place and created more familiarity with the language we chose to accomplish
                                        the tasks outlined, this being Python. As a topic we selected space, and we were
                                        able to find a dataset on Kaggle describing every global space mission that’s
                                        taken place since 1959. We performed a cost analysis on these missions comparing
                                        the cost efficiency of private and public space missions and came to the conclusion
                                        that generally private space missions tend to be more cost-efficient, upon doing
                                        some research we concluded that this was likely due to lightened regulations for
                                        the private sector. My comfortability with python grew substantially throughout
                                        the project particularly with specific popular libraries offered by the language
                                        such as pandas, sklearn, and scipy. The project as a whole really helped me grow
                                        as a developer and data scientist.

                                    <p>The hospital management application that my group and I created, in my software
                                        development course in spring 2021 was one of my most complete projects implementing
                                        a full stack of programming languages. The course was entirely based around a
                                        single project, and we had the entirety of the semester to complete it, communicating
                                        with team members and the client (professor) alike in order to simulate a real world
                                        development experience. Our group elected to work with Java as a backend language,
                                        MySQL for our database needs, MySQL server for hosting the database, and Swing for
                                        the front end of the application. I gained a lot of experience with all of these
                                        technologies and was able to devote a lot of time to developing a complete full
                                        stack application. The communicative dynamic was a unique experience, and I feel
                                        like it improved my ability to express my thoughts, ideas, and questions more
                                        effectively with my team members as well as the client for whom we were developing
                                        the project. Additionally, one of the unique requirements for this project was
                                        documentation with a degree of detail that I didn’t have any prior experience with.
                                        We were tasked with creating an SRS document, class and object diagrams, UI prototypes,
                                        and test case scenarios using JUnit.  The object gave me great exposure to how the
                                        entire development process takes place and gave me more experience using MySQL,
                                        MySQL Server, and Java.
